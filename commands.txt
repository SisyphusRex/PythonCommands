Creating bootstrap file:
    If you want to execute using
    ./main.py
    main.py must have
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    at top of file.
    Otherwise, you must run the main.py using
    python main.py
    **If ./ doesnt work, the python path may be wrong
        1. which python
        2. shows path to python
        3. copy and replace after #!<pythonfilepath>

    Also, the executing file needs:
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            run()

    *See the included main.py for more information
